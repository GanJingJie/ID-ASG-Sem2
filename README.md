# Your Project's Name
Our Project is an Interactive Map that is capable of telling us the situation of COVID-19 in different parts of the world. It will be capable of displaying the confirmed COVID-19 cases and the number of reported deaths. It may be hard to keep updated with the situation on COVID-19 in different countries during these times, especially finding updated and new information on different countries if you were trying to travel to a particular country. This website will help by being able to show the situation on the country that one is searching for and, if required, the surrounding countries.

## Design Process
Our Website is for those who are interested in travelling or are just interested in the situation of COVID-19. This app can help them to search and find out how many cases there are in a particular country or part of the world and how many reported deaths there have been. We also want it to be capable of tallying the total rate of those affected and the total number of reported deaths overall across the globe. 

### User type 
As a user type, I want to be able to see the percentage of particular regions of the globe where the COVID-19 situation may be too dangerous to travel to.

## Technologies Used


JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
